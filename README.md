# Facilities Scheduler
### Cross-Platform Mobile Version of the Facilities Scheduling Web App for US K-12 Schools
> Contributed to the development of a mobile version of the company’s
            web-based facilities scheduling system used by U.S. K–12 schools.
            Focused on iOS development within a shared cross-platform codebase,
            enhancing user experience and feature parity across devices. The app
            enabled school staff to reserve classrooms, gyms, and other
            facilities on the go, improving scheduling efficiency and reducing
            conflicts.
